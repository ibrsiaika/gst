# GST Compliance SaaS MVP Assets

This repository hosts design-time artifacts for the GST SaaS MVP described in the product brief. It currently includes four deliverables requested for developer hand-off.

## Contents

| Deliverable | File |
|-------------|------|
| OpenAPI skeleton | `docs/openapi.yaml` |
| ERD + SQL schema | `docs/data-model.md` |
| UI mockups & component guide | `docs/ui-mockups.md` |
| Bill of materials + Postman outline | `docs/bom-postman.md` |

Each document references the compliance scope (GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, e-invoicing, e-way bills, GSTIN verification) and is structured so engineering can begin implementation immediately.
